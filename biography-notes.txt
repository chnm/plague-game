married middle-aged adult, elderly adult - yep, this is normal, run a variable indicating if first or second or third marriage

widowed child - not legal to get married before 12/14 but wardship and engaged to be married ok, so yours died and you consider yourself widowed but not really
widowed adolescent - can get married at 12/14, more common among elites, women, very bad luck to be widowed so young

dissident artisan - occasional conformity to avoid financial penalties b/c can't pay them
dissident merchant/noble - pay financial penalties but can bear it, faith more important!
    or maybe occasional conformity to avoid social hit to reputation (another variable here???)

Catholic servant - either work for Catholics so okay or keep mouth SUPER SHUT and hidden
Catholic merchant - increasingly okay at higher circles, but keep a low profile when possible
Catholic noble - flaunt it, despite the haters, gets good traction at Court

from London, any social group, great
from England/Scot/Ireland, beggars - have to avoid being deported
    servants - don't have a huge social network, but it's upwardly mobile thing to do
    day labourer - came in search of opportunity, not starving at home
    artisans - hope to be Free of the city? rise in prestige
    merchants - this is where the money and power are
    nobles - have country estate, of course, but come to London for Court, power, prestige
from France, Protestant - come for religious freedom, opportunity
from France, Catholic - Restoration, hope for advancement?
from Dutch Republic, Protestant - come for financial advancement, stuck since now at war, keep head down
from Dutch Republic, Catholic - ditto, with religious complexity, believed C2 when said freedom of conscience
somewhere else - do we want to preserve this as an option?
